## üîß Setup & Development (this section will be removed in the future)

### Frontend
- `frontend/`: HTML + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS  
- Deploys to GitHub Pages via `gh-pages` branch  
- **Make sure**: `script.js` points to your Railway domain

### Backend
- `server/`: Go + Fiber REST API  
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /pokemon?name=<name>` ‚Üí returns JSON card
  - `POST /battle/start` ‚Üí starts session
  - `POST /battle/turn` ‚Üí progress turn via JSON
- Deploy on Railway: setup build = `go build -o main ./server`, run = `./main`
- **Enable CORS** (`app.Use(cors.New())`) so frontend can fetch

### Shared Logic
- `pokemon/`: Fetch and parse PokeAPI
- `game/`: Battle engine, moves, card definitions, turn logic
- Two frontends supported: CLI (via `main.go`) and Web via `server/main.go` and Alpine.js
