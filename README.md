# Pokemon card game using Golang

## This is just the 1st step. 

This is just the baby version of the program. The next step will be to add the ability to play the game.
For now, what it does is, It takes a pokemon name as input and prints the pokemon stats. Soon, this state will be used a card using frontend to make them look like one.
Hopefully this project will be completed within this week. 
Good luck to me!
